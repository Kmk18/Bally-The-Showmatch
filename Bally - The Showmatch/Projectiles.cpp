// Projectiles.cpp currently serves as a placeholder for future
// projectile management functionality. The core Projectile class
// implementation is in Physics.cpp

// This file can be expanded later to include:
// - Projectile factory methods
// - Advanced projectile behaviors
// - Projectile pooling/caching
// - Special effects management
// - Trajectory calculation utilities

// For now, all projectile logic is handled by the Projectile class
// defined in Physics.cpp and managed by the Physics class
